#
# This script is based on the culvert evaluation model developed by Rebecca Marjerison in 2013
#
# This script will:
# 1. Determine the runoff peak discharge of given culvert's watershed using the SCS graphical curve number method.
# 2. Calculate the cross sectional area of each culvert and assign c and Y coefficients based on culvert characteristics
# 3. Determine the maximum capacity of a culvert using inlet control
# 4. Determine the maximum return period storm that the culvert can safely pass before overtopping for both current and
#    future rainfall conditions.
#
# Inputs:
# 1. Culvert Watershed data input: A CSV file containing data on culvert watershed characteristics including 
#    Culvert IDs, WS_area in sq km, Tc in hrs and CN

# 2. NRCC export CSV file of precipitation data (in) for the 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 500 yr 24-hr storm events
#    Check that the precipitation from the 1-yr, 24 hr storm event is in cell K-11
#
# 3. Field data collection input: A CSV file containing culvert data gathered in the field using either then NAACC
#    data colleciton format or Tompkins county Fulcrum app
#
# Outputs:
# 1. Culvert geometry file: A CSV file containing culvert dimensions and assigned c and Y coefficients
#
# 2. Capacity output: A CSV file containing the maximum capacity of each culvert under inlet control
#
# 3. Current Runoff output: A CSV file containing the peak discharge for each culvert's watershed for
#    the analyzed return period storms under current rainfall conditions
#
# 4. Future Runoff output: A CSV file containing the peak discharge for each culvert's watershed for
#    the analyzed return period storms under 2050 projected rainfall conditions
#
# 5. Return periods output: A CSV file containing the maximum return period that each culvert can
#    safely pass under current rainfall conditions and 2050 projections.
#
# 6. Final Model ouptut: A CSV file that summarizes the above model outputs in one table
